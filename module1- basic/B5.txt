Q:Diffrence between inheritance and abstraction
Ans:inheritance is a mechanism to derive one class from other class , we use keyword 'extends' for 
inheritance,
while in abstraction we use keyword 'abstract' to make class abstract, we can extends abstract class,
but we have to implement all methods of abstract class,
abstract class may or may not have abstract methods,
A class declared with abstract can not be intialised
