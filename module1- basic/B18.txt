Q:How do you implement multiple inheritance in dart
Ans:multiple inheritance is not supported in dart,
But there are two ways we can achieve multiple inheritance
1)with the use of interface
2)with the use of mixin

1)Interface:
Dart gives us facility of interface means we can implement one or more than one interface,
but the restriction is we have to implement all the methods/functions of particular interfaces

2)mixin: mixin is created with 'mixin' keyword, in this we do not need to implement/use all 
methods of particular 'mixin',we use with keyword to use mixin with another class
