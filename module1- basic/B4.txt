Q:what is diffrence between inheritance and encapsulation
Ans: In inheritance, gives us facility to reuse the properties of parent class,
while in encapsulation we hide implementation part and showing functionality
in inheritance we use extends keyword to inherit class,
in encapsulation, we can achieve it using making data members private
